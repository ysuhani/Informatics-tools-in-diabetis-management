Maximizing Prevention Through Informatics in Diabetes Management

Research Question 
How can health information technology (IT) be leveraged to enhance the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and maximize prevention efforts?

Objective: 
The project aims to leverage health information technology (IT) to enhance type 2 diabetes (T2D) management and prevention efforts. Through a literature review and analysis, it identifies how IT tools can improve glycemic control, prevent complications, and provide recommendations for optimizing diabetes care.

Methodology: 
- Conducted a comprehensive literature review on the role of health IT in diabetes management.
- Analyzed various informatics tools such as mobile apps, wearable devices, EHRs, telemedicine platforms, data analytics, and predictive modeling.
- Explored the challenges associated with implementing health informatics solutions in diabetes care.
- Identified key findings and trends in the literature regarding the effectiveness of health IT in improving T2D management and prevention.

Findings:
- Health IT tools like mobile apps and EHRs play a crucial role in enhancing glycemic control and diabetes management.
- Wearable devices like smart watches, CGM  offer valuable insights into patients' health status and facilitate timely interventions.
- Data analytics and predictive modeling help personalize diabetes care plans and prevent complications.
- Telemedicine platforms & remote consultations, improving access to care, especially for underserved populations.

Challenges -Include data privacy concerns, interoperability issues, limited access to technology, and regulatory compliance.
